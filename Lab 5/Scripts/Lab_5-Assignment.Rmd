**BEFORE STARTING:**\
1. Include your name (as shown in Brightspace) in the `author` section above as text (e.g., "Liam MacNeil") and Banner ID ("B00123456") in `student_id`.\
2. Install and load the packages required to run your code chunks/

Assignments will largely be evaluated based on your code chunk answers. If they are incomplete or formatted incorrectly (e.g., code chunks don't run), no marks will be awarded. I recommend experimenting with solving these answers in a separate script/markdown document and reporting your answers with minimal script.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Task 1

A)  Define an object `Euler` containing Euler's number (`exp(1)`). Write an `if` statement which tests if this value is positive and if so, create a new object called `growth` which calculates growth amount of a fish weighing 10 kg (P), at a 5% (0.05) growth rate each year (r), over two years (t).

**Growth equation** = P \* e^r \* t^

## Task 2

A)  Define an object `option1` equal to 9, and `option2` equal to 13. Write an explicit `ifelse` statement (not a vectorized version) which tests if one is bigger than the other and if `TRUE`, store this object name in a new variable called `which_max`.
```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

## Task 3

A)  Using the `marine_survey` data frame, create a column called `environments` using an `ifelse` statement with two conditions: (1) `if` `species_count` is greater than the upper third quantile of `species_count` **and** (*&*) `if` `temperature_c` is greater than the mean temperature, call this row "diverse & hot"- if it's not `TRUE`, call this row "not"

**HINT** You can use a vectorized `ifelse` to achieve this. To grab the upper third quantile, check `?quantile` and the `probs =` argument.

B)  Below I calculate the median value of each numeric column where `environments` are "diverse & hot" and store it in a vector called `diverse_hot_envs`. Fix this code to run properly.
```{r}
# Create a data frame
marine_survey <- data.frame(
  station = c("ST1", "ST2", "ST3", "ST4", "ST5", "ST6"),
  depth_m = c(5, 15, 25, 10, 30, 20),
  temperature_c = c(22.5, 18.3, 12.8, 20.1, 10.5, 15.2),
  salinity_ppt = c(35.2, 35.8, 36.1, 35.5, 36.5, 35.9),
  species_count = c(45, 32, 18, 38, 12, 25)
)

# A) 

# YOUR CODE HERE

# B)
# CODE TO FIX
#numeric_columns <- sapply(marine_survey, as.numeric)

#diverse_hot_envs <- sapply(marine_survey[, numeric_columns], function(x) {
 # median(ifelse(marine_survey$environments == "diverse & hot", q, NA), 
  #       na.rm = FALSE)
#})

```

## Task 4

A)  Generate a vector called `sheep` of length 100 counting by 1, from 1 to 100.

B)  Write a `for()` loop which multiples all elements of `sheep` by pi and store this in a vector called `counting_sheep`. *Remember you that need an empty vector to fill and that "[]" lets you store elements in vectors*.
```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE

```

## Task 5

A)  Using the `marine_survey` data frame, use the `lapply` function function to calculate the summary statistics of each numeric column and store this as a `list` called `numeric_summaries`.

B)  Modify the conversion step using `do.call` to flatten this list to a data frame called `numeric_summaries_df`.

C)  Add a column called `variables` using the rownames.
```{r}
#A)
# CODE TO FIX
#numeric_summaries <- vapply(marine_survey(sapply(marine_survey, is.character)), summary)

#B) 
# CODE TO FIX
# numeric_summaries_df <- do.call(cbind, replicate(numeric_summaries, as.data.frame.list))


# C) 


```

## Task 6

Rewrite Task 2 in the lecture exercises (summing total abundance for each species, for each year) using group_by() and summarize() instead of a for() loop. Save in an object called `total_abundance`.

```{r}
# Fish abundance data from lecture exercises
```

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE

```
